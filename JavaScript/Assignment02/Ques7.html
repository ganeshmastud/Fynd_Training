            <h4>When you should not use Arrow Functions</h4>
           
            After learning a little more about arrow functions, I hope you understand that they do not replace regular functions.
            
            Here are some instances where you probably wouldnâ€™t want to use them:
            
            1.Object methods
                When you call cat.jumps, the number of lives does not decrease. It is because this is not bound to anything, and will
                inherit the value of this from its parent scope.
                
                var cat = {
                lives: 9,
                jumps: () => {
                this.lives--;
                }
                }
            2. Callback functions with dynamic context
            
                If you need your context to be dynamic, arrow functions are not the right choice. Take a look at this event handler
                below:
                
                var button = document.getElementById('press');
                button.addEventListener('click', () => {
                this.classList.toggle('on');
                });
                If we click the button, we would get a TypeError. It is because this is not bound to the button, but instead bound to
                its parent scope.
            
            3. When it makes your code less readable
            
                It is worth taking into consideration the variety of syntax we covered earlier. With regular functions, people know what
                to expect. With arrow functions, it may be hard to decipher what you are looking at straightaway.
            <h4>When you should use them</h4>
        
            Arrow functions shine best with anything that requires this to be bound to the context, and not the function itself. 
            Despite the fact that they are anonymous, I also like using them with methods such as map and reduce, because I think it
            makes my code more readable. To me, the pros outweigh the cons.

        const addValues = (x, y) => {
                return x + y
            }
        console.log(addValues(6,7));
        let age=0;
        const incrage = () =>{
            return this.age++;
        }
        console.log(age, incrage);
         console.log(age, incrage);
        
    </script>
